# Project 1 
### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

#### Problem Statement:
Chada Tech is a software engineering company who has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.
#### Clock Example

#### Menu Example

#
Using the above requirements Chada Tech required ISO 8601 compliant clocks in C++ with a flow outline as stated below.

### What did you do particularly well?
I am particularly pleased in how my program displays to the console. After each user input the console clears and the display is updated. As with everything in programming, it could always be done better, but I am happy with what I have created.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by implementing classes. Up to this point we have not reviewed classes but being able to place variables/attributes as public or private would help to make my code more secure. 

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The piece of code I had the most trouble with was the global variables I established for hours/minutes/seconds after separating the functions into their own header files. Ultimately I made another header file solely for those global variables. Additionally, while it wasn't a piece of code, trying to compile the project and fixing bugs was quite a struggle and took a lot of time. Browsing documentation on learn.microsoft.com and CPlusPlus.com was integral in helping me develop this program.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The most transferable skill I have from this is the ability to read and understand documentation. After a while it seems each language is quite similar, and being able to browse documentation to learn the "ins and outs" of the particular language you are using is incredibly helpful.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable and adaptable by dividing each into their own files. This helps by having related functions grouped together, so if the program requirements change, or we want to add new functionality we can easily do this by navigating to the applicable file. This Object-Oriented approach is typically the standard from what I have seen. Additionally, I believe my variable names are descriptive and comments describe what everything does without the entire file being commented out. 
###
Ultimately, I know it can be done better but as a first project I am pleased with the outcome. 


## Version 2
I went back through this program and utilized Classes to enhance my code. I realized when I first created this, it was lacking something that I had not learned about yet. Now, this code is utilizing classes and, while still could be improved, I am satisfied with this result for now.
